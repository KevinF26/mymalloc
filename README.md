This implementation of malloc is based around an initial block of 5000 bytes of memory allocated by the sbrk call which is then broken up into nodes which include metadata such as size, isfree and a pointer to the next chunk. When attempting to allocate memory, the program first checks if there is already a memory chunk in the list that is free and of adequate size. If the size of the available chunk is larger than the required memory size including the metadata, it is broken into two chunks, one to return the caller and one to house the remaining memory in the list. In order to deal with memory saturation, if no adequate chunk is found in the list, it allocates a further block of 5000 bytes ad infinitum (until there is no more system memory to be allocated).

 The free call is implemented by including an isfree flag in the metadata of the dynamic memory allocation. The free function first traverses the list of metadata to make sure the pointer is both in the list of dynamically allocated memory, and has not already been freed. After these criteria are verified, when freeing allocated memory, the metadata is reset to free and an attempt is made to glue this chunk to any contiguous chunks which are also free (in order to combat fragmentation).
